# ROADMAP

Standarize file names:

One option is to have headers like `<algorithm>/kernels.hpp`

and `kernel.cpp` in each folder

Make options to bundle only certain problems and also backends.

Also list them on config.

standarize test and benchmark as `test.cpp` and `benchmark.cpp`

make an stub of the baseline algorithm as `algoritm_baseline` for all problems
